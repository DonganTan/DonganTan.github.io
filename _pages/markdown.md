## Globalized Coercion: The Strategic Logic and Structural Consequences of Economic Sanctions

Economic sanctions have become a cornerstone of contemporary statecraft, deployed by governments seeking to coerce policy change without resorting to armed conflict. Yet in an era of unprecedented globalization—where deep economic interdependence and extensive political integration simultaneously empower and constrain state behavior—the dynamics of sanctions are neither straightforward nor uniformly effective. This dissertation therefore investigates how globalization conditions both the use and the success of sanctions and, conversely, how sanctions feed back on the architecture of global trade. As [Figure 1](#fig-outline) illustrates, my analytical framework begins with globalization, which splits into two dimensions—economic globalization (flows of goods, capital, and the policies that govern them) and political globalization (diplomatic ties, institutional memberships, and treaty networks). For each dimension, we distinguish between de facto measures (actual trade and diplomatic activity) and de jure measures (legal and institutional frameworks). Within the central box of [Figure 1](#fig-outline), these four measures feed into two types of actors—senders and targets—whose interactions determine both the use of sanctions (whether and when sanctions are imposed) and their success (the likelihood of inducing compliance). Finally, sanctions loop back to reshape globalization itself by disrupting trade networks, altering partnership structures, reachability, and bridging capacity, which in turn influences subsequent patterns of economic and political integration.

At the heart of this study lies a central paradox: as states become more economically and politically integrated, they gain leverage to punish others through coercive measures, yet they also incur greater exposure to external pressure themselves. Chapter 2 tackles this tension by dissecting economic globalization, distinguishing between de facto trade flows and de jure policy frameworks. Leveraging a Heckman selection model on cross–national data (1970–2021), I find that economically globalized senders are indeed more prone to initiate sanctions and more likely to achieve compliance, but their own market embeddedness grants them resilience against retaliatory measures. Moreover, targets exploit their network position to dilute sender leverage, transforming trade dependence into a strategic buffer.

Building on these insights, Chapter 3 turns to political globalization—the web of diplomatic alliances, multilateral institutions, and treaty obligations that bind states together. Here, I show that politically integrated senders harness institutional legitimacy and multilateral coordination to amplify sanction efficacy, while globalized targets—especially those with democratic governance—draw on third-party support and legal channels to undercut coercion. This analysis reveals that political globalization is not a unidimensional facilitator of coercion but rather a double-edged sword that reconfigures the strategic calculus of both senders and targets.

Finally, Chapter 4 casts a structural lens on sanctions by mapping their ripple effects through the global trade network. Drawing on network analysis of bilateral trade data (1950–2014), I demonstrate that sanctions inflict lasting damage on a target’s trade partnerships (degree centrality), market reachability (closeness centrality), and bridging capacity (betweenness centrality). A detailed case study of Iran illustrates how targets pursue regional realignment and informal trade channels to restore partnerships yet remain impaired in their intermediary roles.

Together, these chapters yield three principal contributions:

* Multidimensional theory of sanctions: By integrating economic, political, and network perspectives, the dissertation transcends dyadic models to explain when and why sanctions succeed or fail.
* Methodological innovation: The combination of Heckman selection models with network‐analytic measures offers a novel toolkit for capturing both causal leverage and systemic disruption.
* Policy guidance: The findings equip policymakers with a nuanced understanding of the strategic trade‐offs inherent in coercive diplomacy, highlighting how deeper globalization can both empower and constrain state action.

In the chapters that follow, I elaborate this framework in detail, test its implications with rigorous empirical methods, and discuss the broader implications for coercive diplomacy in an increasingly interconnected world.
