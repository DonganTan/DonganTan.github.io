Course Description
======
Political science research differs significantly from common political discourse. Instead of partisan, philosophical, or ideological arguments, political scientists are engaged in research that aims to explain how politics operates. This course gives an introduction to research design and quantitative data analysis, two essential components of political science research. Research design includes the formulation of appropriate research questions, the development of theories and hypotheses, and consideration of issues of causation. The course will also introduce statistics, the standard method for doing social science research. This course focuses on constructing convincing, systematic arguments utilizing empirical facts and data. Statistical analysis is now an crucial ability in business, politics, journalism, policy analysis, and academia. In this regard, the course can also provide a skill set that is highly useful in the real world.
